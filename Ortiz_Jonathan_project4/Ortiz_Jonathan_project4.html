		<p id = 'Rp' class = ' left clear'> is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock
		 formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a 
		 formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. To 
		 successfully complete a climb, one must return to the base of the route safely. 
		 Due to the length and extended endurance required, accidents are more likely to 
		 happen on descent than ascent, especially on the larger multiple pitches (class 
		 III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Rock climbing competitions have 
		 the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or 
		 attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, 
		 another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is 
		 similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated 
		 by its sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to 
		 provide balance.</p>

        <em>Rock climbing </em>is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often
          tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental
           control. It can be a dangerous sport and knowledge of proper climbing techniques 
           and usage of specialised climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of 
          routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the 
          world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and 
          sub-disciplines.[1] While not an Olympic event, rock climbing is recognized
         by the International Olympic Committee as a sport</p>

		<article>
		<p id = "Ap"> is a style of climbing in which standing on or pulling oneself up via devices
		 attached to fixed or placed protection is used to make upward progress. The term
		 contrasts with free climbing in which progress is made without weighting
		 artificial aids: a free climber ascends by only holding onto and stepping on
		 natural features of the rock, using rope and equipment merely to catch them in 
		 case of fall and provide belay.</p>
		
		 <p id = 'Ap2' class = 'clear'>
          In general, aid techniques are reserved for pitches where free climbing is 
          difficult to impossible, and extremely steep and long routes demanding great 
          endurance and both physical and mental stamina. While aid climbing places less 
          emphasis on athletic fitness and raw strength than free climbing, the physical 
          demands of hard aid climbing should not be underestimated.
		
          Aid climbing is sometimes errantly referred to as class 6 climbing, since its 
          reliance on ascent by one's equipment rather than merely being protected by it 
          is regarded by purists as falling outside the traditional Classes 1-5 Yosemite 
          Decimal System rankings that rely on making progress with one's hands and feet 
          in direct contact with the rock alone. Aid climbing has its own ranking system, 
          using a separate scale from A0 through A5.[1]</p>

		<h2 id = "Free" class = 'clear'> Free climbing </h2>
		
		 <p class = "extend clear"> is a specific rock climbing term that was created in contrast with aid 
		climbing. It refers to climbs in which climbing protection such as ropes, tri-cams
		, nuts, and other aid-climbing equipment, may be used to protect against injury 
		during falls, but cannot be used in ascending the climb. The term free climbing 
		originally meant "free from aid".[1] Free climbing includes solo climbing, 
		traditional climbing, sport climbing and bouldering. In contrast, in aid climbing,
		climbing equipment is used to assist the climber in ascending the climb and can 
		include a means for pulling the climber upward or providing points where the 
		climber can stand on equipment to assist in the climb.

		<h2 id = "Boulder" class = 'clear'> Bouldering</h2>
		<p class = "extend clear"> is a form of rock climbing that is performed without the use of ropes or 
		harnesses. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers 
		use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry, and 
		bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which 
		is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber 
		takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 20 feet tall. 
		Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without 
		natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats,
		 take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>

		 <h2 id = "Lead" > Lead climbing </h2>
		 <p id = 'Lp'>is a climbing technique used to ascend a route. This technique is 
		 predominantly used in rock climbing and involves a lead climber attaching 
		 themselves to a length of dynamic (elastic) climbing rope and ascending a 
		 route while periodically attaching protection (quickdraws or traditional 
		 protection) to the face of the route and clipping into it. The lead climber must 
		 have another person acting as a belayer. The belayer has multiple roles: holding 
		 the rope in the event of a fall, and paying out or taking up rope as the climber
		  moves.</p>
		  <p id = 'Lp2'>
          As lead climbing does not require a pre-placed anchor at the top of the route,
          it is often seen as less restricted than top roping. Also, because a lead
          climber does not have an anchor point above them while climbing, only the 
          limbs and body of the climber are used to affect upward progress. Protective 
          devices are only placed to catch the climber in the event of a fall.
